# More to know

The goal of this chapter was to get a brief overview to all the possible elements of a Scratch program. A lot of these elements are basic functionalities, which you can also find in different other programming languages. Some are more specific to Scratch and already combine different low level functions to more complex elements. With these functionalities you are already setup to develope different complex tasks. Feel free to experiement with your new knowledge and see what you can already do with it.

## Structure and discipline

For the small tasks we did as examples, no additional structure is necessary to understand the purpose of the program. But as your program code and complexity are growing, more structure will come in handy. The different possiblities to structure your code will be discussed in the next chapter. Never the less I will provide some final example here to show, what we can already do with the learned elements. But as this example will be more complex I will already use some of the structural elements we will learn about in the next chapter.

## Example program

The example could be the first step to have your own point and click adventure. In similar ways it is quite easy to think of some astroid shooter or other known game genres. As you can see we are already using two seperated functions to structure the code, called *My Blocks* in scratch. They can be specific to one sprite or can be available to all elements in your code. In this case they are quite specific to the sprite and therefore also designed to be only available to it alone.

Even if this examples is already more complecated than our tasks in the chapter, there are still a lot of things, which could be optimated. The cat is looking only in one direction no matter in which direction it is moving. We can also direct the cat to move over the bed and walk through the air, which should probably not be the case. And perhaps only moving the cat around is not enough to provide some fun experience. These are only few examples, that we still have some way to go until we will have a interesting program... So let's get going.
