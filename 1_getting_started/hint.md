# More insides

In this chapter, the goal was to learn about the programming IDE, which we will use in this course. It is a very brief introduction to the functionality we can and will use.

## Tutorials

To get more insides you can also have a look at the *Tutorials*, which are already part of the IDE. They give a more detailed description to the different part. They have step by step descriptions and are very condensed to one specific feature. Give it a try, if you feel you need a closer look about specific topics.

## Examples

The example prject files provided with this introduction are limited to only use the features discussed in the subtasks of this chapter. You will notice, that they are not at all a functional program. For example the sprite can only move in specific directions, which is not very convinient. Also the sound will play from the beginning to the end, even if the sprite is no longer moving. So we probably need to separate the different actions into multiple blocks or functions, so that they can work more individually to what is done on the screen.

All these functionalities will be covered in future chapters and you will see how the program evolves through out this journey. You can already now tinker with the possible functions and see how it could work out. Developing good programming skills are most often a combination of knowledge and curiosity. Trial and error as well will be part of getting a better developer.
