# 1. Getting started

This is meant to be the tutorial of this course. The intention is to give you a first intorduction to the Scratch editor. It will cover some basic information where to find stuff and how to combine simple blocks to a first functional program.

## 1.1 Grafic editor

Scratch includes a grafical editor to create your own spreads. These spreads and grafics can be later on used in your program. It is an easy way to have some grafical output of your code.

Let's see how it works. When opening the Scratch editor you will see your grafical components on the right side of the screen. By default in a new project file a cat is visible in the screen up right. This is the first default sprite of any project. All your projects sprites as well as the backgrounds, can be seen in the lower right corner. There are also two buttons for adding/creating new sprites and backgrounds.

Your first task is to add some additional sprites and/or backgrounds to your project.

## 1.2 Grafical programming

Next part of the IDE is the *Code* area on the left. If you processed the first exercise you already used the *Costumes* tab. Now we want to use the *Code* tab to have some easy first code implementation to our program.

The code blocks are sorted into different categories, which discribe the purpose of the blocks. For example you have a *Motion* categorie, which is used to move sprites around. There are categories very specific to Scratch, which already abstract some logic in it, but there are also more general elements like *Variables* or *Control*. These are more basic operations, which you will find in similar ways in the most programming languages. Last but lost least there is a category named *My Blocks*, which can hold blocks you designed on your own. This is very similar to functions or methods in other languages. Generating on blocks to reuse logic is a very common solution in programming to not do the same logic over and over again.

The task of this chapter is to make yourself familiar with the different code blocks and try to move your sprite around the screen. Check out what happens when you create multiple move operations at the same time to one sprite.
