# Scratch beginners guide

This project is meant to be a introduction into programming. It will teach you the most basic parts of a program. We will start by zero and no knowledge should be needed to follow the exercises.

To acomplish this tasks we will use the scratch grafical programming tool. It can be used either in a web browser interface [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/), or as a desktop app for several different platforms ([downlaods](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)).

## Structure

The project is structured in different folders. Each is representing one chapter of the course and has a *exercise.md* file in it. The exercise file will include all the information needed to compete the task of this chapter.

As in programming there is not one correct solution, there will only be an example project. This will give an idea of how a solution could look like. But if you reach the goal in some other way, this is fine, too.

In some chapter there will also be a *hint.md* file. Inside there are some additional information to the given task, to possible different solutions, pros and cons to them and information to the learning purpose of the chapter.
